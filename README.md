And while you guys are building, today's happening, I want you guys to put yourselves in the shoes of an individual that's building an actual AI system. for business owners. want to medium size. Makes sense? if you guys put yourself there. How many here know that the Super Bowl, a lot of the reasons why people watch the Super Bowl is because of the ads? raise your hand. The ads are a big part. For international students here, the ads are, like, about 30 to 40% of the reason why some people, like, watch the game. Make sense? And halftime. Huh? And halftime. And half action. They will be a good one. That be right. So I'm going to read you guys the actual challenge word for word. I'm gonna give you guys the exact, you know, recommended text app and how you guys should build. You guys are gonna have about 4.5 hours to build. We're going to have finalists that actually are going to demo. And yes, this is a hapathon that's going to be a winner. 
### So the actual challenge. 
Build an AI powered tool that helps small to medium-sized businesses capitalize on the Super Bowl Buzz in real time. This is not about producing a Super Bowl app. It's about a real time reaction. Smart automation and real business impact. Your AI system should help a small business react quickly to what is happening during the Super Bowl. Generate timely relevant marketing content. Launch or suggest promotions tied to live moments. For cultural buzz into customer engagement or sales. Think in terms of something just happened, what should this business do right now? Does that make sense? Raise your hand.. Any questions so far? We're on sanitation? So we got through the Super Bowl as we're going. Yeah, individually, I'll. And guys, as we as you guys go into your teams and build, our pulse team is going to come around. It's not like we just announce the problem, we don't have coffee, and then I'll see you guys in 4 or 5 hours. That's not how this works. We're gonna be involved in every step of your building process. 
### So requirement number one, real world data. 
Your project must use real data from live APIs or process visual data for actual insights. Bocus points for both. 
### Requirement number two, deploy and working live. 
Your project must be publicly accessible and functional during judging. You must deploy your application to a live environment, not just a local host. providing working URL or access method, demonstrating the full flow live, real data, API process, business output. 
### What the judges will look for, judges, me, co founder, Dilad, co founder, Mark, quote, DJ, Peter. 
What we're gonna be looking for, the raising right now. Let give them a round of applause, John. Let's Okay. Real world data ingestion. Did the team successfully use live external data? 
### Number two, live deployment 
is the product working in a real deployed environment. 
### Number three, latency. 
How long elapsed between the TV moment the AI response is? For business impact. Right? You guys know what business is. More eyeballs, means usually more like sales. Attempt, money balls attention. It's gossip. 
### four? 
Smart use of AI is AI meaningfully powering content, decisions for automation. 
### Six, usability 
### 7 demo quality. 
So the way you present matters. Right? So that will matter. Perception is reality. So if you guys have a phenomenal product, but you cannot demonstrate it and explain it clearly, it'll be it'll be taught to one. And for those of you in the room, how many how many of you, this is your 1st half on ever? Raise your hand. Hi, raise it high. be proud. One, two, three, four, five. Let's give them a round of applause. Whoo! Or the skill set is not just to build a phenomenal product. It's having the ability to communicate. and being able to demonstrate what is in your mind, what you deduce, an actual workflow, into an actual PRD, into this is what we built and this is why we built it. And this is how it makes a difference. Make sense? All right guys. Thank.
